Description: Ceylon language
 This is the Ceylon language packaged for Debian.
 .
 Ceylon is a programming language for writing large programs in a team environment. 
 The language is elegant, highly readable, extremely typesafe, and makes it easy to get things done. 
 And it's easy to learn for programmers who are familiar with mainstream languages used in business computing. 
 Ceylon has a full-featured Eclipse-based development environment, allowing developers to take best advantage of 
 the powerful static type system. Programs written in Ceylon execute on any JVM.
